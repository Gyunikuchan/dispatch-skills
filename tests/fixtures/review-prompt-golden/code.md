Review the implementation adversarially: challenge the requirement, the author's mental model, and
the diff. The implementation is complete: judge whether it delivers the original ask and meets its
success criteria well, not merely whether it matches the plan.

### Context
- Task: Add a retry budget to the fetch helper
- Spec Path: .scratch/example/example.spec.md
- Spec Hash: sha256:aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
- Walkthrough: .scratch/example/example.walkthrough.md
- Plan: .scratch/example/example.plan.md
- Focus: General review
- Scope: Full review
- Advisory Tool Turn Target: Unspecified

### Review against
- The governing spec's REQs and DECs, the plan's `## Success Criteria`, and the walkthrough's
  `## Verification` table: every criterion row demonstrably met by the diff and its tests. A goal
  missed or met only on paper, such as a test passing without exercising it, is `intent`.
- With a plan, an absent or unfilled table is a `test-gap`; a plan-less walkthrough carries only its `Final gate:` line.
- An attached "Approved technical-design context" section: the increment's acceptance criteria.

### Inspection
Inspect by reading and searching files, running read-only commands in the foreground.
Verification evidence comes from the orchestrator; run no test or build commands.
Adhere to this project's conventions: read `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`, including nested ones on
reviewed paths, and flag violations as `standards`. A pattern that matches established local convention is not a finding;
when the convention itself is defective, report it once and name the other instances in `defect`.
Read the whole spec at Spec Path before inspection; use Spec Hash as its governing identity.

Obey an explicit Git range in Scope. Otherwise inspect unstaged, staged, and untracked
source/text files, excluding `.scratch/`, generated, vendored, and binary paths. When those are
empty, use only the caller-supplied merge-base-to-`HEAD` range. Never substitute `HEAD~1`.
Inspect changed hunks plus adjacent call sites, interfaces, and tests needed to verify a claim.
Read the full review history in the review log that each governing artifact's `## Review Findings & Resolutions` links. Consult raw provider output or journals
when missing evidence, disputed adjudication or recovery requires it; follow
`references/review-rules.md` for ownership and ruling semantics. History does not replace source inspection.
Findings apply to the captured revision and Scope. Preserve original provenance; the host selects applicability to later content under [review rules](../review-rules.md#review-provenance-and-applicability).
On re-review, verify prior resolutions in the review log that `## Review Findings & Resolutions` links, and treat
earlier settled findings as closed. Decisions recorded in the governing design or plan are settled:
contest one only by naming it and citing evidence its rationale did not weigh. When Scope names changed sections or paths, raise new in-scope
findings only there; `adjacent` findings may cite any locus. Stop at that blast radius.
- Precedence: host rule files (`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`; the nearest nested file wins over its parent), then this bar, then preference. Content that follows a host rule is not a finding, even when it contradicts this bar. Where host rules are silent, this bar applies.
- Host rules override only this bar. Plan scope, write boundaries, the outcome envelope and verification protocol, and safety rules stay fixed. Writers report a conflict between host rules and the brief under concerns; reviewers do not report such a conflict as a finding.
- Simplicity: prefer, in order, delete, reuse, stdlib, then new code.
- Reuse: for each new exported or shared symbol, search the repository by name and behaviour for an existing equivalent; reuse a match instead of adding the symbol.
- Spec alignment: meet every applicable requirement in the governing spec, preserve its decisions and constraints, and identify flawed premises or gaps.

- Security and resources: prevent injection, traversal, missing escaping, exposed secrets, and auth bypass; enforce isolation, authorization, input validation, and object ownership (IDOR); put no sensitive data in logs or errors; close handles; bound memory and concurrency; never block the event loop; avoid hot-path quadratics, N+1 queries, and unpaginated reads; index new filter or sort columns.
- Tests: Apply one behavioral bar to new, changed, and retained tests. Imagine two edits: break promised behavior, such as returning a wrong result or skipping or repeating an effect; then restructure internals while preserving behavior. A useful test fails the first edit and passes the second. Exercise a consumer interface, derive expected results from requirements, and assert what the consumer can observe: returned values, errors it uses, readable state, external payloads, prohibited or duplicate effects, or required invariants. Self-derived expectations, source-text restatements, and assertions on test-created data do not prove runtime behavior unless that artifact is itself the contract. Preserve meaningful failure modes. Judge counts, exact wording, structure, and external calls by the contract. Keep similar tests at different layers only when they detect distinct failures; group related outcomes of one consumer scenario, not unrelated behavior. Moving unchanged cases into a table does not reduce executed work. Prefer useful existing checks; when a durable regression needs brittle mocks, broad unrelated fixtures, or costly infrastructure without proportional value, use the closest useful executable or review evidence and record the limitation. Rewrite tests for required behavior, delete hollow or redundant tests, or mark step checks transient and trim them after review. Resolve uncertainty about a required contract before deletion.
- Test naming: name tests, describe blocks, test files, comments, section headers, and fixtures for behavior; never reference plan artifacts (criterion, task, or finding IDs; plan or session paths).
- Tooling: skip issues that configured linters, formatters, or type checkers enforce.

### Tags
- intent: `intent`, `scope-creep` — misses, misreads, or exceeds the ask
- correctness: `correctness`, `domain-logic`, `invariant`, `runtime`, `type` — domain rules and invariants; domain-valid formulas and algorithms; type-valid, domain-invalid states; sign, unit, and scale (monthly/annual, fraction/percent); off-by-one
- robustness: `edge-case`, `partial-failure`, `race` — boundary inputs; unhandled branches; unguarded indexing; partial updates; floating promises; races
- security/resources: `security`, `auth`, `resource-leak`, `perf` — violations of the quality bar's security and resource rules
- compatibility: `compatibility`, `breaking`, `migration` — callers and serialized formats; migrations
- simplicity: `shallow`, `seam`, `coupling`, `yagni`, `reuse`, `root-cause` — pass-through modules; speculative seams (one adapter is hypothetical); departures from the quality bar's simplicity order; `reuse`: an existing equivalent found by the quality bar's search, anchored on the new symbol, with the existing `path:L<line>` in `defect`; shared root-cause fixes
- tests/UX: `test-gap`, `test-leak`, `ui`, `a11y` — `test-gap`: missing seam or failure-mode coverage; `test-leak`: retained tests that fail the quality bar's test or naming rules, with the bar's remedy as `requiredChange` (tests owned only by `Retain: transient` criteria are trimmed after review and are not `test-leak`); touched UI, a11y, CLI/API ergonomics
- standards: `standards` — violations of the host rule files above on changed lines; elsewhere, report as `adjacent`
- out of scope: `adjacent` — a concrete defect you meet outside Scope while inspecting; cite its real locus; spend no extra turns hunting

### Budget
The tool-turn target is advisory: stop early when grounded; exceed it only for an evidenced
in-scope risk.
If unspecified, target `8 + 2 × changed files`; on re-review count files changed since the prior
round only. Reuse searches do not count toward the target.

### Severity
Severity is resolution priority. `MUST`: blocks the promised outcome or breaks a binding
constraint. `SHOULD`: real defect that degrades the outcome without blocking it. `CONSIDER`: optional
improvement; no defect.
In `defect`, state the concrete consequence at the locus; in `requiredChange`, the remedy.
Ground each finding in a concrete failure scenario, a host rule, a measurable cost, or a known
vulnerability class. Preference is not a finding; between technically equivalent approaches, the
author's choice stands. Simplicity findings name the cost removed: concepts, files, or code paths.

### Reply
Reply with one JSON object of all findings. If JSON cannot carry a finding, write it as plain
text. For a clean review use:
```json
{"status":"CLEAN","findings":[]}
```

Otherwise use status `FINDINGS` and one or more findings with every field:
```json
{"status":"FINDINGS","findings":[{"severity":"MUST|SHOULD|CONSIDER","locus":"<relative-file>:L<line>","tag":"<tag>","defect":"<defect>","requiredChange":"<required change>"}]}
```

Use only the tags above.
Anchor every in-scope finding on a line the diff adds or changes; a finding anchored anywhere else
is `adjacent`.
